== Story ==

=== Adventure Hook ===

Relevant 5e.tools page: https://5e.tools/adventure.html#CoS,1,adventure%20hooks

Before making characters, ask if everyone would prefer to start at level 1 or
level 3.

- Ask preference to start at level 1 or level 3
- Level 1:
  - Use [[#Plea For Help]] party hook
  - Run [[#Death House]] to advance the characters to level 3
- Level 3:
  - Use [[#Mysterious Visitors]]

Or, if they come up with a good way that their characters would know each other
or be travelling with each other, use the "creeping fog" adventure hook.

==== Plea For Help ====

Characters are approached by [[#Arrigal]], who has been sent to deliver a message
to the party to plead for help. He is secretly working for Strahd!

If the players decide not to listen to Arrigal, they should be surrounded by the
creeping fog when the leave the tavern for their next destination.
