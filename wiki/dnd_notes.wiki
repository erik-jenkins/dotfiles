== Running the Game #58: Making Travel Interesting ==

- Want to present the world as a real place, where interesting things can happen
  during travel.
- Have permission to just fast-forward travel! Unless just getting around is the
  point of the adventure.
- Our job as DMs is to advance the plot.
- If you do want to make it interesting (give it tension), use a skill challenge
  from 4e.
  - Players collectively work on a challenge.
  - Players say what skills they're going to use and how they're going to use them
  - They have to accumulate a certain number of successes (easy: 3, hard: 6) before
    accumulating three failures.
